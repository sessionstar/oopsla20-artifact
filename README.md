The purpose of this document is to describe in details the steps required to assess the artifact associated with our paper.
We would like you to be able to:
* reproduce our benchmarks from Table 1, Section 5.2 and 5.3. For that purpose, complete [Part I (Step 1)](#step-1-run-the-microbenchamarks-table-1-section-52-and-53) of this document.
* compile the examples, reported in Table 2, Section 5.4. For that purpose, complete [Part I (Step 2)](#step-2-compile-applications-implemented-with-session-table-2-section-54) of this document.
* test the running example (HigherLower) from the paper, described in Section 2. For that purpose, complete [Part II (Step 1)](#step-1-execute-the-runnign-example) of this document.

Additionally, you can test and modify any of the examples we have implemented ([Part II, Step 2](#s#step-2-observe-refinement-violations)), as well as implement and verify your own protocols ([Part II, Step 3](#step-3-run-other-example-optional)) using our toolchain.

## Getting started

For the OOPSLA'20 artifact evaluation, please use the docker file provided:

1. Make sure you have docker installed ([install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
2. Run the docker container:
```
docker run -it docker.pkg.github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/artifact:latest
```
Note: if you get the error: no authentication, then login to docker:
```
~/TOKEN.txt | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u USERNAME --password-stdin
```
where TOKEN.txt should conatin your Github authentication token (see how to generate one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token))

3. The docker file comes with a vim installation, if you prefer to use other editors or your local vim set-up, you should enable [docker directory mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).

In the following, we assume that you are in the ```/home/sessionstar/examples``` directory.
## Artifact layout

In addition to the source code of the library, which is a git clone of the [sessionstar repository](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact), the artifact also contains
* a [scripts](examples/scripts) folder, which includes the scripts for producing the results from Table 1 and Table 2.
* an [examples](examples/) folder, which contains various examples, including the source for the running example from the paper, i.e HigherLower (Section 2), and the applications from Table 2.
* a [template](template/) folder that gives you template files and guides you through implementing and testing your own examples
* ```sessionstar``` command. The command generates F* callbacks from Scribble protocols (See Part II (Step I)).  

## Part I: Quick start
We have provided several scripts that allow you to quickly test the main claims of the paper.
A step by step explanation on how to use the toolchain, and how to test each example separately is deferred to Part II of this document.
### Step 0: Test that all examples can be executed

```
cd examples
make
make run
```
The above script verifies and executes all implemented examples.  

### Step 1: Run the microbenchamarks (Table 1, Section 5.2 and 5.3)

The purpose of these set of benchmarks is to demonstrate the scalabilty of our tool on protocols of increasing length (as explained in Section 5.2). We also measure the execution overhead of our implementation by comparing it against an implementation without session types or refinement types, which we call bare implementation (as explained in Section 5.3).

To execute the benchmarks run:

```
python3 scripts/pingpong.py
```

The produced table (which corresponds to Table 1 from the paper) contains the following columns. In brackets we give the name of the corresponding columns from Table 1.
* ```Gen Time (CFSM)``` - the time taken for Scribble to generate the CFSM (```CFSM```)
* ```Gen Time (F\*)``` - the time taken for the code generation tool to convert the CFSM to F\*. (```F\* APIs```)
* ```TC Time (Gen.)``` - the time taken for the generated APIs to type-check in F\â‹†(```Gen. Code```)
* ```TC Time (Impl)``` - the time taken to time check the implementation (```Callbacks```)

The script runs the example 30 times and displays the average.
(TODO: 1. explain the option to adjust n, 2. option to adjust how many times the example are run; 3.explain the option to run remotely)

**Note:** The result in the paper run the experiments under a network of latency of 0.340ms (64 bytes ping), while the script runs the examples in the same docker container.  


### Step 2: Compile applications implemented with Session* (Table 2, Section 5.4)

The purpose of these set of benchmarks is to show the expressivity of our toolchain. We have taken examples
from the session type literature, and have added refinements to encode data dependencies in the protocols (as explained in Section 5.4).

To run all examples at once:
```
python3 scripts/examples.py
```
The produced table corresponds to Table 2 from the paper.
It contains the same columns as the table produces in Step 1. Note that Table 2 from the paper reports:
- the total generation time, which is a sum of the ```Gen Time (CFSM)``` and ```Gen Time (F*)``` from the produced table.
- the total time checking time, which is a sum of ```TC Time (Gen.)``` and ```TC Time (Impl)``` from the produced table.

The source code (protocols and implementations) for each of these examples is located in a separate folder.

## Part 2: A walk-through tutorial

### Framework Overview

<details>
<summary>
Unfold here for a quick overview of the tool.
</summary>

**In a nutshell** The Session* toolchain enables verification of <em> refined </em> multiparty session protocols and programs. Refined multiparty protocols express data dependent protocols via refinement types on the payloads. The toolchain allows users to specify, implement and verify data dependent protocols, i.e protocols with payload and control-flow constraints.

**How**
Users can describe a protocol in the protocol description language [Scribble](scribble.org) and implement the endpoints in [F*](fstar.org) using refinement-typed APIs
generated from the toolchain. Then, the F* compiler statically verifies the refinements and ensures that the protocol is free from deadlocks and communication errros.

An overviwew of the toolchain is given below (the figure corresponds to Fig.2 from the paper).
![](images/framework_overview.png)

Programming with Session* starts by writing a protocol in Scribble. Then the user has to:  
:one: **generates** from a Scribble protocol a CSFM representation of the protocol and an F* API. We provide a command (```sessionstar```) that takes a protocol, parses it, and generates the corresponding files. The ```sessionstar``` tool is the **main artifact of the paper.**  
Outputs: CFSM file and F* API file .  
:two: implement and **compile** - in this stage, the user has to supply an endpoint implementation (an implementation of the business logic using the generated F* API from stage 1). Then the user has to verify the implementation using the F* type checker.
Outputs: F* binaries.  
:three: **execute** -- finally, when all endpoints are implemented, the user executes the program, and enjoys the guarantees provided by the toolchain.  
Outputs: a running program  

**Guarantees** If all endpoints in a protocol type-check, then the execution of the protocol is guaranteed to proceed without deadlocks, and/or communications errors/mismatches. Hence, a well-typed implementation inherits the core communication properties of the theory (as explained in Section 4).

**Note on discrepencies**  
On F\*: The formalisation in the paper assumes that only default effects are used (terminating and side-effect free). In reality, F* supports arbitrary ML effects. Hence, the user can compromise progress if they opt-in to use arbitrary effect ML, which permits state mutation, non-terminating recursion, exceptions, etc.

On Scribble: We have extended the syntax of Scribble to support refinements. In addition to the guarantees described in the paper, Scribble supports additional validation as to ensure that the specified refinements are satisfiable. Note that this validation is optional. It is useful for early detection of protocols that are not realisable.

There are minor syntactic dependencies w.r.t the Scribble syntax fpr refinements in the paper, for details see [Note on discrepencies](#note-on-discrepencies).

### Step 1: Execute the runnign example
The purpose of this section is to give you a quick walk through of using the toolchains to implement and verify a protocol. We focus on the running example - [HigherLower.scr](/examples/HigherLower)

:one: **generation**: the first step of our toolchain is the generation of callback signatures from Scribble protocols. The ```sessionstar``` command takes a file name, a protocol name and a role. To generate the callback file for role A for the HigherLower protocol, i.e ```HigherLower/HigherLower.scr```:
 ```
 sessionstar HigherLower/HigherLower.scr HigherLower A
 ```
 The ```sessionstar``` command  (1) generates a CFSM and (2) produces the callback signatures in F*. It produces the corresponding files:
   -  ```HigherLower_A.fsm``` - contains the CFSM for role A  
   -  ```GeneratedHigherLowerA.fst``` - contains the generated API, as callback signatures, for role A.

 A user has to implement the program logic for each callback from the generated API file (```GeneratedHigherLowerA.fst```).

<!-- A sample implementation of role A is given in ```HigherLower/HigherLowerA_CallbackImpl.fst```. -->

:two: **compilation**: after we implement the program logic for role A  using the callback signatures produced in the previous step, we can verify that the implementation is correct by running the F* type checker.

 A sample implementation of role A is given in ```HigherLower/A/HigherLowerA_CallbackImpl.fst```. To compile this implementation for endpoint A, we first move the generated file to the correct folder, and then we build the endpoint using the F* compiler:
```
mv GeneratedHigherLowerA.fst HigherLower/A
make -C HigherLower/A main.ocaml.exe
```
 The above command generates the binary for role A,  ```main.ocaml.exe```.


:three: **execution**: repeat the above steps (generation and compilation for role B and C). After all endpoints have been implemented and their binaries have been generated, we can run them.
 To run all endpoins:
```
HigherLower/B/main.ocaml.exe & HigherLower/C/main.ocaml.exe & HigherLower/A/main.ocaml.exe
```
 The above command runs the three endpoins, i.e A, B and C.

### Step 2: Observe refinement violations

Next we highlight how protocol violations are ruled out by static refinement typing, which is ultimately the practical purpose of Session*.

(a) **Refinement violations:** Change the implementation for role B.
Below we suggest two modifications.

 First, ensure that the current implementation is correct:
```
sessionstar HigherLower/HigherLower.scr HigherLower C
mv GeneratedHigherLowerC.fst HigherLower/C
make -C HigherLower/C main.ocaml.exe
```
  After each modification, compile and observe that an error is reported. Note that since we are not changing the protocol, you do not need to run sessionstar again, it is enough to run the F* type checker using ```make -C HigherLower/C main.ocaml.exe```

 Suggested modifications:
 - Modify the condition for the lose case ([Line 32](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/B/HigherLowerB_CallbackImpl.fst#L32)) from ```t >0``` to ```t=0```

 - Comment the lose case ([Line 32-33](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/B/HigherLowerB_CallbackImpl.fst#L32)).
Note: the syntax for comments in F* is (* commented code *).

(b) **Use of proof-irrelevant variables:** To demonstrate how our toolchain uses reasoning with latent information, we will modify the protocol HigherLower, and we will compile the  implementation for role C.

First, we verify that the implementation of C is correct:
```
sessionstar HigherLower/HigherLower.scr HigherLower C
mv GeneratedHigherLowerC.fst HigherLower/C
make -C HigherLower/C main.ocaml.exe
```
Suggested modifications:
  - Modify the implementation such that the higher case sends a variable that is lower than the current one. For example change Line [34](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/C/HigherLowerC_CallbackImpl.fst#L34) from ```next := (Mkstate72?.x st) + 1)``` to ```next := (Mkstate72?.x st) - 1)```. Compile the endpoint (```make -C HigherLower/C main.ocaml.exe```) to observer an error.

  - Modify the protocol by removing all constraints for x that depend on n.
    - Change [Line 19](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/HigherLower.scr#L19) from ```@'n>x && t>1'``` to ```@'t>1'```
    - Change [Line 23](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/HigherLower.scr#L23) by commenting ```n=x'``` (comment in Scribble is \\\ )
    - Change [Line 30](https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/blob/4061441dbdea9cb4ec7567af4e0efb2390174359/examples/HigherLower/HigherLower.scr#L30) from @'((n<x || n>x) && t=1)' to ```@'t=1'```

   Since we changed the protocol, new callback signatures have to be generated. Generate new callback signatures and compile:     
 ```
 sessionstar HigherLower/HigherLower.scr HigherLower C
 mv GeneratedHigherLowerC.fst HigherLower/C
 make -C HigherLower/C main.ocaml.exe
 ```

### :exclamation:__Note__ on syntax discrepancies:

There are small syntax discrepancies between Scribble syntax and the paper.

TODO: A quick explanation on the main differences...

For details, see the [notes on Scribble syntax](README.md#notes-on-scribble-syntax).

### Step 3: Run other example (Optional)

To build a selected example from Table 2:
```
make build-[name of the example]
```

To run a selected example from Table 2:
You can run them using:
```
make run-[name of the example]
```

See the [Makefile](examples/Makefile) for more details.  

Each examples is in a separate folder. The folder contains:
- The protocol, specified in Scribble - a file with extension .scr
- a folder for each role in a protocol. Each role folder contains:
  - Generated API file (automaticaly generated by the toolchain) - the name convention of such files is Generated[ProtocolName][RoleName].fst. Note that this file will be generated only after running the ```sessionstar``` command on the target protocol.
  - Callback Implementation file (specific to the implementation, should be implemented by the user)- the name convention of such files is [ProtocolName][RoleName]_CallbackImpl.fst
  - Boilerplate files (non-specific to the implementation):
    - Payload.fst - specifies serialisation of the payload types (e.g int, strings)
    - Network.fst - standard communication functions for send/receive

#### Step 2: Implementing your own protocols (Optional)

Create a simple calculator protocol, following the short tutorial here.

Hint: If you are struggling, the Calculator folder contains the full implementation, and you can use it for reference.


##  Additional information (Debugging tips)
* If you have problems compiling the examples, try:
 * rm .depend;
 * make clean-[example-name]
* A socket error ECONNREFUSED:
 * the error indicates that you have not started the roles in the expected order, you should always start the server role first.
